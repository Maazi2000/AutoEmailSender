# AutoEmailSender
The program allows you to send e-mails with reminders to people from the database (sqlite) whose return date has passed

# Run
To run this app you should clone this repository and create .env file just like .env.example.

To run the project, enter: $ python main.py

Database will be created automaticly.

# Technologies
The program works on Python 3.10 and uses libraries sqlite3, smtplib, dotenv, datetime.

If you don't want to send an email to someone right away, I recommend using [mailtrap.io](https://mailtrap.io/), to see what it looks like
